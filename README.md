> List of tools and techs I use as a designer and developer

I'm a fullstack web developer but any one of us have a tail to tell about our cool other skills and tools. This is not a resume and doesn't list skills, but things I like to use or do from now on.


### Tools as a developer
- [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) / [ack](beyondgrep.com)- My true friend as I lay my hand and touch those keys. This is what every coder should learn and use for faster and better typing and searching.
- [Atom](https://atom.io) - Github open source editor. You can change and customize it the way you prefer just like a browser.
- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) - I can't remember all those weird hard to memorize git commands, so this is my GUI.
- [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com) / [FishShell](https://fishshell.com) - It's closed by default but I've made a keyboard shortcut for iTerm to appear so it's everywhere.
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion) - If I ever want to write C++ on mac.
- [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) - I'm using it for what it is and It's got everything I want.
- [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch) - Sometimes I need to monitor I/O of an application I'm developing.
- [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) - Monitoring using all the tools even the ones I have no idea what they are.
- [Fritzing](fritzing.org/) - Easily design electronic circuits for Arduino in no time.
- [OsmondCocoa](www.osmondpcb.com/) - Sometimes I need to build a ready to print for some home-made circuits.


### Front-End libraries and frameworks I like more than others at the moment
I've done Angularjs/Meteor/Backbone but this is what I'd like to do now:
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - Split all those js files to small situational bundles, so client doesn't have to download them all at once.
- [Universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) - Let's share js code between client and server + SEO friendly + faster to render
- [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) - Makes comparing all those nested arrays and objects faster.
- [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) - Everything is a stream! or observer or whatever
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - Not because it's fast, makes me write clean and easy to reason about code, both in front and back-end
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - Much better than apps I made with Ionic.
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org), [Chai](chaijs.com/) - I use these tools for BDD.
- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) - When your app gets larger and larger, you can still predict weird stuff. That's all I can say about this piece of art.
- [GraphQL](https://facebook.github.io/graphql) - Really hard to implement for small apps but faster.
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) - Javascript syntax is weird. It doesn't even have a method for a array deep copy.
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) / [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) - After all the Sass/Less/Stylus fights, I like it this added on top.
- [fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) - I'm mentioning this cause it's getting a standard soon and there are many other libs doing the same.
- [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io) - Makes development easier by syncing all monitors and devices together for test(well not easier than Redux dev tools)


### Back-End libraries and frameworks I use more than others
- [Drupal](https://drupal.org) - I've built blog, portfolio, government web sites using Drupal. If I have to use PHP I use Drupal as a framework(since version 6).
- [Node](https://nodejs.org) - Ofcourse.
- [Express](expressjs.com/) - Sometimes I think about Koa...
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) - If all I need is a small php based application


### Techs or products I like to use or research about as a web developer
- [ServiceWorkers](https://serviceworke.rs/) / [WebWorkers](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/05/a-taste-of-javascripts-new-parallel-primitives) - Future of web apps in mobile and desktop, Seriously.
- [SVG](https://css-tricks.com/using-svg) - I need to make cooler animated websites.
- [Canvas](www.html5canvastutorials.com) - Actually let's export one of these out of Adobe Animate.
- [Functional Programming](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide) - Pure functions equals easier tests(no mocks), less/cleaner/faster code.
- [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com) - Makes real-time app easier to develop and scale.
- [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) - better than forever.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Future of containers.
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) - Easy to setup but powerful clustering for Dockers.
- [Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) - A good practice but hard to pull off when building something great.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/), [Passport](passportjs.org) ,[bcrypt.js](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js/) - Security is so complicated you can't do it for yourself. Let's just stick to best practices for now.


### Stuff I like or use as a web designer
I'm not a graphist or web designer but I've made more than 40 hours of animation using Flash and Photoshop. I left that part of my beloved life behind and now I only use them for web porposes.
- [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) - Using it just for web and mobile UI design with [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/).
- [Adobe Animate](www.adobe.com/products/animate.html) - I used to call it Macromedia Flash 5.
- [Adobe Illustrator](www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) - So hot for me right now, great SVG export.
- [Adobe Photoshop](www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) - Right now I only use it for editing other designers PSDs.


### Daily tools I use all the time
- [MBA](www.apple.com/macbook-air) - Next time I'll get a Pro for an upgrade.
- [Slack](https://slack.com) - It changed how we communicated as a team, but it's a source of distraction in fact.
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com) - Loved it first time I launched it. Reminded me of playing WoW using TeamSpeak. Also replaces Slack for me.
- [Microsoft OneNote](https://www.onenote.com) - This is much better than Evernote. This piece of handy app is always open.
