> List of tools and techs I use as a designer and developer

I develop both front and back-end or anything related to web, but any one of us have a tail to tell about our cool other skills. This is not a resume and doesn't list skills, but things I like to use or do from now on.


### Tools as a developer
- [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) - My true friend when I lay my hand and touch those keys with my fingers. This is what every coder should learn and use.
- [Git] - Duhh!
- [Atom](https://atom.io) - Github open source editor. You can change and customise it the way you prefer just like a browser.
- [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com) - I can't remember all those weird hard to memorize git commands, so this is my GUI.
- [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com) - It's closed by default but I've made a keyboard shortcut for iTerm to appear so it's everywhere.
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion) - If I ever want to write C++ on mac.
- [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) - I'm using it for what it is and It's got everything I want.
- [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch) - Sometimes I need to monitor I/O of an application I'm developing.
- [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) - Monitoring using all the tools even the ones I have no idea what they are.
- [Fritzing](fritzing.org/) - Easily design electronic circuits for Arduino in no time.
- [OsmondCocoa](www.osmondpcb.com/) - Sometimes I need to build a ready to print for some home-made circuits.
