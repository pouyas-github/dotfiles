> List of tools and techs I use as a designer and developer

I develop both front and back-end or anything related to web, but any one of us have a tail to tell about our cool other skills. This is not a resume and doesn't list skills, but things I like to use or do from now on.


### Tools as a developer
- [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) - My true friend when I lay my hand and touch those keys with my fingers. This is what every coder should learn and use.
- [Atom](https://atom.io) - Github open source editor. You can change and customise it the way you prefer just like a browser.
- [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com) - I can't remember all those weird hard to memorize git commands, so this is my GUI.
- [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com) - It's closed by default but I've made a keyboard shortcut for iTerm to appear so it's everywhere.
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion) - If I ever want to write C++ on mac.
- [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) - I'm using it for what it is and It's got everything I want.
- [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch) - Sometimes I need to monitor I/O of an application I'm developing.
- [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) - Monitoring using all the tools even the ones I have no idea what they are.
- [Fritzing](fritzing.org/) - Easily design electronic circuits for Arduino in no time.
- [OsmondCocoa](www.osmondpcb.com/) - Sometimes I need to build a ready to print for some home-made circuits.


### Front-End libraries and frameworks I like more than others at the moment
I've done Angularjs/Meteor/Backbone but this is what I'd like to do now:
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - Split all those js files to small situational bundles, so client doesn't have to download them all at once.
- Isomorphic Universal - Let's share js code between client and server + SEO friendly + faster to render
- [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) - Makes comparing all those nested arrays and objects faster.
- [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) - Everything is a stream! or observer or whatever
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - Not because it's fast, makes me write clean and easy to reason about code, both in front and back-end
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - Much better than apps I made with Ionic.
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org), [Chai](chaijs.com/) - I use these tools for BDD.
- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) - When your app gets larger and larger, you can still predict weird stuff. That's all I can say about this piece of art.
- [GraphQL](https://facebook.github.io/graphql) - Really hard to implement for small apps but faster.
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) - Javascript syntax is weird. It doesn't even have a method for a array deep copy.
- [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - After all the Sass/Less/Stylus fights, I like it this way.
- [fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) - I'm mentioning this cause it's getting a standard soon and there are many other libs doing the same.
- [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io) - Makes development easier(well not easier than Redux dev tools)


### Back-End libraries and frameworks I use more than others
- [Drupal](https://drupal.org) - I've built blog, portfolio, government web sites using Drupal. If I have to use PHP I use Drupal as a framework(since version 6).
- [Node](https://nodejs.org) - Ofcourse.
- [Express](expressjs.com/) - Sometimes I think about Koa...
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) - Sometime all I need is a small php based application


### Techs or products I like to use or research about as a web developer
- Service Worker - Future of web apps in mobile, Seriously.
- SVG - I need to make cooler animated websites.
- Canvas - Actually let's export one of these out of Adobe Animate.
- Functional programming - Pure functions equals easier tests(no mocks), less/cleaner/faster code.
- [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com) - Makes real-time app easier to develop and scale.
- [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) - better than forever.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Future of containers.
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) - Easy to setup but powerful clustering for Dockers.
- Microservices - A good practice but hard to pull off when building something great.
- Debian based linux - Why Debian? Cause that's all I have experience with and love. I mean Ubuntu.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/), [Passport](passportjs.org) ,[bcrypt.js](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js/) - Security is so complicated you can't do it for yourself. Let's just stick to best practices for now.


### Stuff I like or use as a web designer
I'm not a graphist or web designer but I've made more than 40 hours of animation using Flash and Photoshop. I left that part of my beloved life behind and now I only use them for web porposes.
- Adobe Animate - I used to call it Macromedia Flash 5.
- Adobe Photoshop - Right now I only use it for editing other designers PSDs.
- Adobe Illustrator - So hot for me right now, great SVG export.
- Sketch - Using it just for web and mobile UI design with [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/).
- Adobe Experience Design - It's new and cool, not using it that much but I'm investigating.


### Daily tools I use all the time
- MBA - Next time I'll get a Pro for an upgrade.
- [Slack](https://slack.com) - It changed how we communicated, but it's source of distraction in fact(too many notifications).
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com) - Loved it first time I launched it. Reminded me of playing WoW using TeamSpeak. Also can replace Slack for me.
- Microsoft OneNote - This is much better than Evernote. This piece of handy app is always open.
