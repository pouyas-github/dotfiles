> List of tools and techs I use as a designer and developer

I'm a fullstack web developer but any one of us have a tail to tell about our cool other skills and tools. This is not a resume and doesn't list skills, but things I like to use or do from now on.


### Tools as a developer
- [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) / [ack](http://beyondgrep.com) / [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)- My true friend as I lay my hand and touch those keys. This is what every coder should learn and use for faster and better typing and searching.
- [Atom](https://atom.io) - Github open source editor. You can change and customize it the way you prefer just like a browser.
- [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) - I can't remember all those weird hard to memorize git commands, so this is my GUI.
- [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com) / [zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) - It's closed by default but I've made a keyboard shortcut for iTerm to appear so it's everywhere.
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion) - If I ever want to write C++ on mac.
- [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) - I'm using it for what it is and It's got everything I want.
- [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch) - Sometimes I need to monitor I/O of an application I'm developing.
- [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) - Monitoring using all the tools even the ones I have no idea what they are.
- [Fritzing](fritzing.org/) - Easily design electronic circuits for Arduino in no time.
- [OsmondCocoa](www.osmondpcb.com/) - Sometimes I need to build a ready to print for some home-made circuits.


### Front-End libraries and frameworks I like more than others at the moment
You know I've done Angularjs/Meteor/Backbone but this is what I'd like to do now:
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - Split all those js files to small situational bundles, so client doesn't have to download them all at once. I also prefer npm scripts over gulp and grunt configs.
- [Universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) - Let's share js code between client and server + SEO friendly + faster to render
- [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) - Makes comparing all those nested arrays and objects faster.
- [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) - Everything is a stream! or observer or whatever
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - Not because it's fast, makes me write clean and easy to reason about code, both in front and back-end.
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - Much better than apps I made with Ionic and this time truely native.
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org), [Chai](chaijs.com/) - I use these tools for BDD.
- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) - When your app gets larger and more complex, you can still predict weird stuff. That's all I can say about this piece of art.
- [GraphQL](https://facebook.github.io/graphql) - Really hard to implement for small apps but faster.
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) - Javascript API doesn't even have a method for an array deep copy.
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) / [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) - After all the Sass/Less/Stylus fights, I like it this added on top.
- [fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) / [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) - I'm mentioning this cause it's getting a standard soon and there are many other libs doing the same.
- [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io) - Makes development easier by syncing all monitors and devices together for test.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/), [Passport](passportjs.org) ,[bcrypt.js](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js/) - Security is so complicated you can't do it for yourself. Let's just stick to best practices for now.
- [GSAP](http://greensock.com/gsap) - Animating better than vanilla.js or jQuery.

### Back-End libraries and frameworks I use more than others
- [Drupal](https://drupal.org) - I've built blog, portfolio, government web sites using Drupal. If I have to use PHP I use Drupal as a framework(since version 6).
- [Node](https://nodejs.org) - Ofcourse.
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - Sometimes I think about Koa...
- [Meteor](http://meteor.com) - If it needs to be done ASAP.
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) - If all I need is a small php based application


### Techs or products I like to use or research about as a web developer
- [ServiceWorkers](https://serviceworke.rs/) / [Progressive](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) / [WebWorkers](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/05/a-taste-of-javascripts-new-parallel-primitives) - Future of web apps in mobile and desktop, Seriously.
- [SVG](https://css-tricks.com/using-svg) - I need to make cooler animated websites.
- [Canvas](www.html5canvastutorials.com) - Actually let's export one of these out of Adobe Animate.
- [Functional Programming](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide) - Pure functions equals easier tests(no mocks), less/cleaner/faster code.
- [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com) - Makes real-time app easier to develop and scale in cluster.
- [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) - better than forever.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Future of containers.
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) - Easy to setup but powerful clustering for Dockers.
- [Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) - A good practice but hard to pull off when building something great.
